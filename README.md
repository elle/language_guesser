# LanguageGuesser


## Development and Thoughts Process

There are a few ways one can approach this problem. For example by using ngrams, bloom filter, bayesian filtering or decision trees.
I decided to implement a very basic bloom filter in this case

* Step 1: have a hash of most common words in a language
* Step 2: compare string with langauge, and return the highest matching options

## Other decisions:

* Build this library as a gem
* Allow for strings and text files to be checked


## Assumptions

* Limiting the usage of external libraries and web services
* Allowing accented characters for languages such as Spanish
* Expecting properly typed language: for example, we are not checking for Spanish words that are not accented
* I am not differentiating between Portuguese and Brazilian-Portuguese
* No learning capabilities for future reuse is implemented in this version

## Future improvements

* Increase the ammount of common words to check against (as well as the size of the filter)
* Using bits and redis for faster data retrieval
* Using a different hashing algorithm, again for improved performance.
