# LanguageGuesser


## Development and Thoughts Process

There are a few ways one can approach this problem. For example by using ngrams, bloom filter, bayesian filtering or decision trees.
I decided to implement a very basic bloom filter in this case, returning an array of most probable language matches

## Other decisions:

* Build this library as a gem
* Allow for strings and text files to be checked


## Assumptions

* Limiting the usage of external libraries and web services
* Allowing accented characters for languages such as Spanish
* Expecting properly typed language: for example, I am not checking for Spanish words that are not accented
* I am not differentiating between Portuguese and Brazilian-Portuguese
* No learning capabilities for future reuse is implemented in this version

## Future improvements

* Increase the amount of common words to check against (as well as the size of the filter)
* Using bits and redis for faster data retrieval
* Using a different hashing algorithm, again for improved performance.
* Using a two step elimination to look at the characters unicode ranges to decide what language it is before moving on to applying the filter


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'language_guesser'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install language_guesser

## Usage

    require 'language_guesser'
    'je ne sais pas'.language

or

    require 'language_guesser'
    f = File.open('test/fixtures/english.txt', 'r')
    LanguageGuesser.new(f).guess
